Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks. They are widely used in machine learning for various tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Here are the key aspects of Artificial Neural Networks:

1.  **Neuron or Node**:
    
    -   A neuron or node is a fundamental building block of an Artificial Neural Network.
    -   It receives input signals, performs computations, and produces an output.
2.  **Input Layer**:
    
    -   The input layer of an ANN receives the initial input data or features.
    -   Each input node represents a feature or attribute of the input data.
3.  **Hidden Layers**:
    
    -   Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers.
    -   They perform complex computations and extract higher-level representations from the input data.
4.  **Output Layer**:
    
    -   The output layer of an ANN produces the final predictions or outputs.
    -   The number of output nodes depends on the nature of the problem (e.g., binary classification, multi-class classification, regression).
5.  **Activation Function**:
    
    -   Activation functions introduce non-linear transformations to the outputs of neurons.
    -   Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), tanh, and softmax.
6.  **Weights and Biases**:
    
    -   Weights and biases are parameters that determine the strength of connections between neurons.
    -   They are learned during the training process to optimize the performance of the network.
7.  **Forward Propagation**:
    
    -   Forward propagation refers to the process of passing input data through the network and computing the corresponding output.
    -   Each neuron performs a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function, and passes the output to the next layer.
8.  **Backpropagation**:
    
    -   Backpropagation is a training algorithm used to adjust the weights and biases of an ANN.
    -   It calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters and updates them accordingly.
9.  **Loss Function**:
    
    -   A loss function measures the discrepancy between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.
    -   Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), categorical cross-entropy, and binary cross-entropy.
10.  **Training and Optimization**:
	 * ANN training involves iteratively presenting input data, calculating the loss, and updating the weights and biases.
    -   Optimization techniques like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and Adam optimizer are used to find the optimal set of parameters.
11.  **Deep Learning**:
    -   Deep learning refers to the use of ANNs with multiple hidden layers.
    -   Deep learning models can automatically learn hierarchical representations and capture complex patterns in the data.
